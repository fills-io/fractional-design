const QUESTIONS = [
  {
    q: "Is the output actually usable, or just a vibe?",
    a: "Both. The brief covers eight design dimensions: palette, materials, lighting, furniture, ceiling, flooring, spatial notes, and overall vibe. Each one comes with real references you can buy, build, or copy. It's the same shape senior studios deliver to clients.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to know design language to use this?",
    a: "No. You point at images that feel right. The engine handles the design language: the names of styles, the material specs, the technical terms. You walk in with taste and walk out with a brief.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from saving images myself?",
    a: "Saving images gives you a wall of vibes. A brief turns that wall into eight specific dimensions a contractor or designer can quote against. Same starting taste, structured output.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my contractor be able to work from the brief?",
    a: "Yes. Every brief includes specified materials, a six-color palette with usage notes, a lighting plan, and reference images per category. We export it as a PDF you can hand over directly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can designers send the brief to clients?",
    a: "Yes, and many do. The brief is structured the way studios already brief clients: same shape, same depth. You can export it in your studio's colors and add your logo before handoff.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a brief actually take?",
    a: "From a minute to ten, depending on which door you pick. Drop a reference image and the brief comes out in about a minute. Pick three things in Quick mode and it's about five. Step through every dimension yourself in Full Studio and you're around ten.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I don't like what gets generated?",
    a: "Swap any reference, regenerate any single dimension. The brief stays internally consistent without restarting from scratch. If you want a different overall direction, change one of your three picks and the engine rebuilds around it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who built this?",
    a: "A working architect who's spent years briefing clients across residential, hospitality, and commercial work. The engine is trained on the way senior studios actually scope a project, and is in daily use by working architects and interior designers.",
  },
  {
    q: "What formats and customization options are available?",
    a: "PDF or shareable digital link. Landscape or portrait orientation. White-label with your own logo and studio colors when you send it to clients.",
  },
