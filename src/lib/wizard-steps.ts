/**
 * Single source of truth for the wizard's step ordering.
 *
 * Steps are deliberately listed in the order the user moves through them.
 * Anywhere in the app — the progress bar, the URL slugs, the step renderer —
 * we resolve from this array so adding/reordering a step is a one-line change.
 *
 * Ported from the Replit prototype's `client/src/pages/new-concept.tsx`,
 * with the same nine steps. Names match the wizardSelections schema keys
 * in src/db/schema.ts where applicable (vibeStyle ↔ vibe, etc.).
